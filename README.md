# NewsGate
This project implements an API Gateway with JWT authentication for secure access control. Users log in to receive a token, which determines their role (Admin, Premium, or Regular User) and grants access to specific news APIs. The frontend, built with Streamlit, displays role-based content and includes sentiment analysis for admin users.
